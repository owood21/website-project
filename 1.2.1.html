    <h1>The ongoing use of IT tools and change the approach as needed in making your own website, 
        are you happy with the tools you used?  E.g. Visual Studio Code, Code-pen, Trello</h1>
        <br></br>
    
    <p> 
    The ongoing use of IT tools used in making my own website are visual studio code and Trello.
    Visual studio code is an ongoing tool used because at this moment in time we have only covered 
    Html however in the future we will move onto CSS which will them allow the website become more
    creative.
    Code-pen is also an ongoing tool used as it is where you can test and demonstrate User-created all 
    the languages html, JavaScript and CSS however this is an online community. 
    Code pen is a good place to start if you have never done coding as it allows you to save work and 
    for an example if you made a mistake in a piece of code you can go back and see where you went wrong.
    Trello is a great ongoing tool if you are creating a website as it allows you to create different
    checklist for each element of the website having the checklist helps you with time management 
    and productivity you can also add subtasks to these.</p>
