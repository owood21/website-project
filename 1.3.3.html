<h1> solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h1>
<br
><p> To develop a solution to improve my own productivity using It
     in digital project by using Trello as it very easy tool to use and you can
    see where you are up to in certain parts in the project. Trello would 
    also very good to use when working in a team as you can see where 
    your team is up to .In my final project I didnâ€™t use trello as it was to 
    much messing about changing different components as
I had to keep going back over to check if it was all correct .  </p>
