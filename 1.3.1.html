<h1> .1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools 
and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency could you have been more efficient? 
when making your website? How? Could you have 
done it in teams?</h1>
<p> The benefit of it tools I could of use trello more to help me more 
    with time management as I am coming to the end of the project and 
    feel like I haven’t been as productive as I could have been 
    when completing this project. I don’t think it would have been suitable 
    to do this in teams as this was a personal project however if were 
    to do this in a team I think we would have to decided how many pages
     the website ws going to be and then split the work up between us    </p>
