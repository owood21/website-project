<h1> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h1>
<p> To test the digital solution, I would test every aspect of the website. 
    Starting off with the homepage and make sure that everything
     appears including the images, text and the navigation bar then to 
     test the link to each page I would go through the website in a strategical order
     and tick off as I test and if it didnâ€™t work I would fix the issue on the spot </p>
