<p>I would use trello as I can use this as you can have multiple checklist 
    in one place. I would also use trello as you can colour code each item
     to a certain colour for example you would mark red with something 
     you are struggling and you need to revisit, then you would could mark 
     green as something you have completed and you understand well enough to do it over and over</p>
