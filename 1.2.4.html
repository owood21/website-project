<h1>The strengths and weaknesses of your final project
are you happy with your website </h1>

<p> The further improvements I would like to make is add a slide down menu
     so instead of having every single section on the navigation 
     I would only have 5 navigation button these would be for home page about me, 
     assignment 1 brief, assignment 2 brief and index I would then want a drop-down menu 
     of assignment 1breif and assignment2 brief and this would show all the point covered in
      each assignmen </p>
