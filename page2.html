        <p>There are many Methods needed to complete a digital project successfully,
        These are Scoping, Planning, Development, Testing & deployment and Maintenance.
        
        Scoping is the 1st phase and this is where you can come up with ideas and you can 
        assess different options and possibilities in this phase you can think 
        about potential threats and challenges.
         
        After the scoping in the first phase, the more planning can begin. 
        You sit down and go through the function, requirements and the road map and go through the functionality, requirements, and the roadmap how to achieve it. 
        Planning includes creating a detailed plan for the implementations of the ideas is laid out and put into an agreed plan. 
        
        Development is the process of developing or being developed and this is where the requirements and rough designs 
        should be in place and given to the development team. The development process will follow progression for 
        back end to front end. 
        The back-end setup is crucial because this is a foundation for the following development and end experience.
        
        Deployment and testing are the last stage before the product will be in the hands of the end user. 
        It might seem easy but deployment is a crucial step as everything needs to be tested and various use-cases 
        might be taken into account 
        
        Maintenance is the stage after the product has been delivered.The maintenance will take over, 
        the maintenance is a continuous part of improving the product fixing and improving the functionality, stability and offering additional 
        support of the product.
