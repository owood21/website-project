<h1>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them </h1>
<br>
<P> People with disabilities face many problems. However, when using a webpage,
    they will only have issues with sight impairment and reading. They can 
    overcome this by zooming in on the section they want to read and it will make
    the text larger for them to read. The way they can overcome  with the reading 
    issue ,the website could have a speaking option so the website speaks the 
    paragraph selected </P>
