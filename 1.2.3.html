<h1>3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project
    are you happy with your website? Why? Why not?
       </h1>

    <br>
    <p> My strength of my final project is that I have got the right amount of content on each page.
         I have also got a colour scheme/design, the colour scheme I have got in mind is blue, orange and white
          as it looks clean and simple and it also link in with code nation as orange and blue is used in their logo. 
          The weakness of my final project is understanding the code to insert an image.  </p>
